Implemented by me are only functions in dictionary.c. Rest was submitted by CS50 staff. What dictionary does is basically loads a dictionary in by hashing the words and then unloads the file by releasing the memory. The check function verifies whether the word was in fact in dictionary hashing a word from a text file. Long description can be found on: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/5/speller/.
