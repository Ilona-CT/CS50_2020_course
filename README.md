# CS50_2020_course
As a programming newbie taking course introducing to computer Science prepared by Harvard University.
Liked it from the very first "Hello World" :) 
Starting with: 
- C (here e.g.: loops, arrays, algorithms, hash tables, pointers), 
- moving on to Python (discovering many minutes spent on C solutions could have been solved much faster), 
- SQL (sqlite 3), 
- tracks with e.g. basics into web programming with html, css, JavaScript and Python.
